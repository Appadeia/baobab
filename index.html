                        Project Baobab is a homebrew collection for D&D 5e with builders at heart in mind. No longer do you have to wait on the world to bend to you, you can bend the world yourself.

                    <p>
                        Here's a quick overview of what we have:

                        <li>A New Class - Step out of the way, wizards, there's builders in town now!</li>
                        <li>New Items - It's not a homebrew pack without these.</li>

                    <h2 id="structure">Structures</h2>
                    The Structure is a building, either small or large. Structures are split into two types: Major and Minor Structures. Major Structures are typically buildings, while Minor Structures are typically small single-purpose constructs.

                    <h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
                    Construction is the process of building Structures. Some classes and races are better suited to it, while others can barely perform it. Construction requires materials and people, as well as a blueprint. Construction follows patterns of checks, which are composed of lists. Some constructions require multiple people to do checks at a single time. These are typically indicated in pattern lists as checks joined by &. The DM has discretion over what tools are needed for construction. Failing a check in a chain means that some resources are wasted at the discretion of the DM, and the check needs to be redone with new resources.

                    <h3>Builder's Practice</h3>
                    At 1st level, pick one of your proficiencies with tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any checks that make use of the tool.
                    <br> <br>
                    At 8th level, pick two more of your tool proficiencies to gain double proficiency.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Architectural Intuition</h3>
                    Starting at 1st level, knowing how structures are typically put together, you can roll a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check to guess layout and purpose of the rooms with entries adjacent to your current room. This does not work if there is only one room with an entry adjacent to your current room.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Builder Profession</h3>
                    At 2nd level, you decide to pursue an avenue of study more specific than the one you’re on.
                    <h4>Builder Professions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Siege Builder - Build large weaponry as your main form of attack.</li>
                        <li>Environmental Builder - Take advantage of your environment when building.</li>
                        <li>Construction Worker - Build structures with unparalleled efficiency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    At 6th, 10th, and 16th levels, you get a new profession feature.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Civic Improvement</h3>
                    Starting at 3rd level, you are able to make small improvements to the terrain to make passing over it easier. These include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ladders up to 10ft high</li>
                        <li>Stairs with up to 20 steps</li>
                        <li>Levelling uneven terrain up to 20 ft in a flat radius, excluding cliffs or other sharp changes in terrain.</li>
                        <li>Bridges smaller than 10 feet.</li>
                    </ol>
                    It takes about 30 minutes and a quarter cubic foot of a material to make one of these.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Construction Consistency</h3>
                    Starting at 3rd level, your constructions are starting to get better. Whenever you fail a pattern check while constructing something, you can roll a DC15 dexterity check to see if you can reuse all materials used in the pattern.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
                    At 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
                    <br> <br>
                    You do this again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th levels.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Repairing</h3>
                    Starting at fitfh level, your construction ability is to the point where you can now repair existing constructions. You need materials similar to the ones that were used to construct the construction you’re repairing. For patterned constructions, you perform 2 items from the construction’s pattern. For other constructions, roll a DC15 Dexterity and a DC10 Intelligence check. Failing a check wastes some materials at DM discretion.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Quick Station</h3>
                    Starting at 6th level, you have enough skills to be able to set up quick workstations and disassemble them. It takes 15 minutes to assemble and 5 minutes to disassemble. You are able to build:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Furnace, provided you have stone and a fire source. It can smelt ores and bake foods.</li>
                        <li>Forge, provided you have metals. It is used for tinkering with metal items.</li>
                        <li>Workstation, provided you have wood. It is a workstation for whatever you need to do with one. Watch tinkering, scribing, whatever.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Quality</h3>
                    Starting at 6th level, the quality of your work is starting to get better. Your pattern rolls now have advantages.

                    <h3>Siege Builder</h3>
                    <h4>Quick Weapon</h4>
                    Starting at 2nd level, you are able to create a small construct out of a quarter cubic foot of any wood in about ten minutes. Ranged weapons such as guns, bows, and crossbows can be mounted on it to increase their ranges by 30/20 feet. This small construct can be moved.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h4>Siege Wall</h4>
                    Starting at 6th level, you are able to create a small wall about 5 feet tall by 5 feet wide with an AC of 15 using a quarter cubic foot of wood in fifteen minutes. You can hide behind it, or use it to block openings smaller than its size. If the wall has not taken any damage, you can deconstruct it into its original materials. It can be moved, and multiple of these walls can be combined to form a larger one.
                    <br> <br>
                    <h3>Environmental Builder</h3>
                    <h4>Adobe</h4>
                    Starting at 2nd level, you are able to create adobe bricks from mud and
                    dirt. During a long rest on a sunny and hot day, you are able to create a quarter cubic foot of adobe bricks. 
                    <br> <br>
                    <h4>Environmental Improvement</h4>
                    Starting at 6th level, you are able to improve the environment with improvements such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Levelling terrain in a circular radius 10ft or smaller over an hour. This cannot be done if the differences between height span more than 3 feet.</li>
                        <li>Seperating a chunk of terrain and improving it to be better for plant growing. This takes about an hour per twenty square feet. This cannot be done in deserts, swamps, rocky, or mountainous terrain.</li>
                        <li>Basic irrigation such as runnning water from a river for no longer than 100 feet away, small resevoirs less than 100 cubic feet, and dams less than 5' by 5'.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Inanis Gladio</h3>
                    A sword made out of Vodoaine, the Inanis Gladio takes advantage of Vodoaine’s negative weight to offer a swinging speed so fast that the sword behaves more like a forcefield of pain than an actual sword. Being made out of ingots with negative weight, the Inanis Gladio is so unstable that it requires the user to fuse the sword back together with a 12DC Strength check every dawn. Failing the check causes the sword to disintegrate back into its ingots. Being heated beyond 100oF or cooled below 20oF can also require the user to fuse the sword back together. <br>
                    When a creature wields the Inanis Gladio, their jump height is increased by 5 feet. Additionally, a creature has advantage on Acrobatics checks made while wielding the Inanis Gladio. A creature can also use an action to repel all creatures smaller than size large in a 5ft circular radius to the edge of the circular radius 5 times a day.

                    The construct seems to be aware as to who its owner(s) are at all times. It can tell the difference between being stolen and sold.
                    <h4>Slow but Steady</h4>
                    The construct is relatively unaffected by bad terrain, always maintaining its speed, excluding sharp cuts and inclines more than 45°.

                    <h3>Light of Plant</h3>
                    A lamp created from a mixture of Lychnus and Vitrearum, the Light of Plant is a special lamp. It emits bright pale green light in a 15 feet radius. All plants that have been within this light for at least six months yield 1.5 times their normal harvest. Additionally, a spell of 1st level can be channeled into it to make all normal plants within its light become overgrown. Creatures moving through the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. A creature attempting to channel spells higher than 1st level into the lamp must make a saving throw with their casting ability with a DC of 10 + the spell's level. On a successful saving throw, the effect expands 20 feet for every spell level. On a failed saving throw, the Light of Plant overflows with energy and explodes, causing all creatures within a 15 feet radius of it to take 1d4 damage for every spell level above 1st.
